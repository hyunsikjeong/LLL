# Babai's Algorithm

Babai's algorithm is the most well-known algorithm for solving the closest vector problem(CVP).
You can find out the description about what is the CVP from this Wikipedia article:
[Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_problem).

## How to use

There's only one function, `def Babai_CVP(mat, target)`:
- `mat`: The matrix that forms a lattice. You can put non-square matrix here.
- `target`: The target vector.
